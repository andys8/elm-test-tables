module Expect.Category exposing (associative, commutative, idempotent, identityElement, zeroElement)

{-| Expect.Category provides expectations for common properties of binary functions, like `(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)` or `(a+b) = (b+a)`:

    fuzz3 int int int "+" <|
        \a b c -> { f = (+), a = a, b = b, c = c }
            |> Expect.all [ associative, commutative ]

These mathematical properties are actually quite useful, so try to follow a few of them for whatever data type you're building.


# How to use this module

The function signatures in this module are horrible. Sorry about that. Here's how I intend the functions to be used:

    fuzz3 int int int "+" <|
        \a b c -> { f = (+), a = a, b = b, c = c }
            |> Expect.all [ identityElement 0, associative, commutative ]

or

    fuzz3 appendable appendable appendable "++" <|
        \a b c -> { f = (++), a = a, b = b, c = c }
            |> Expect.all [ associative ]

or

    fuzz3 number number number "max" <|
        \a b c -> { f = max, a = a, b = b, c = c }
            |> Expect.all [ zeroElement (1 / 0), identityElement (-1 / 0), associative, commutative, idempotent ]

{-| Associativity is the property that `(a ⊕ b) ⊕ c = a ⊕ (b ⊕ c)`, or `f (f a b) c = f a (f b c)`, for some infix operator `⊕`, or binary function `f`.

Notable examples include `+`, `*` and `max`, but note that float operations generally aren't associative.

{-| Idempotence is the property that `a ⊕ a = a`, or `f a a = a`, for some infix operator `⊕`, or binary function `f`.

Notable examples include `0` for `+`, `1` for `*` and `0` for `Bitwise.or`.

{-| The zero element is the element `0` such that `a ⊕ 0 = 0 ⊕ a = 0`, or `f 0 a = f a 0 = 0`, for some infix operator `⊕`, or binary function `f`.
